 * Generates a simple flat grid mesh which will be used as the water. Very
 * similar to how the "split terrain" was generated in tutorial 55. Each
 * triangle of the mesh has its own 3 vertices so that no vertices are shared
 * between triangles. This allows for the flat-shaded look as the
 * normals/lighting values aren't interpolated across multiple triangles.
